# TwitterHD
A browser extension that forces twitter to always load images in full resolution

Tested in desktop Firefox

## Installation (Firefox)

Clone the repo.

Go to `about:addons` and click the settings icon. Select "debug addons".

Click "Load temporary add-on", and select the manifest file.

## TODO:

- Chrome instructions

- Package it properly and get it in the various extension stores?

- See if something similar can be done to Twitter's videos
